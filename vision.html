				<h2 tabindex="6">Music</h2>
				<p>I grew up in a family of musicians, so listening to music has always been something I prioritize, so much so that using <a href="https://music.apple.com/profile/abbyrhart" tabindex="7" target="blank">Apple Music</a> has become a part of my personality. Here are some songs and albums I've had on repeat recently: <br></p>

				<h2 tabindex="8">Movies</h2>
				<p>I took a film class for two years in high school, and ever since then I have been very into going to the movies with friends and using apps like <a href="https://letterboxd.com/abbyrhart/" tabindex="9" target="blank">Letterboxd</a> to document what I watch. Here are some of my recent views: <br></p>

				<h2 tabindex="10">Books</h2>
				<p>I have always been a bookworm, but during high school I stopped reading as much. This year, my new years resolution was to read more books, and so I started using <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/138718765-abby-hart" tabindex="11" target="blank">Goodreads</a> to track how much I was reading. I read 80 books this year because of their 2022 Reading Challenge, here are some of the best!: <br></p>
